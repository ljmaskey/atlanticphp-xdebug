atlanticphp-xdebug
==================

I recently gave a presentation for Atlantic PHP, talking about using XDebug for profiling and code coverage. This is the repo of code that I used for that presentation.

I have included the slides (based on reveal.js) and in the 'notes' for the slides I reference various versions of the code. If you want to follow the code with the slides, each version I reference in the notes is also a tag in the repo.
